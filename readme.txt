Duplicated scripts in the driver folder for the three 'types' of cards supported by the framework (web, webx, and rpc)
Renamed scripts according to the following conventions:

*** Driver folder script/spreadsheet naming convention ************************

prefixes (a script name must begin with one of these prefixes)

cfg - Configuration Tab script
con - Control Tab script
dat - Data/Logs Tab script
def_rd	- Read data after resetting a value to default
def_wrt - Write data prior to resetting a value to default
func - Verify functionality
mon - Monitor Tab script
snmp - SNMP protocol script
tbl - Verify text in a table

suffixes (a script name must contain one of these three suffixes immediately prior to the file extension)

web		- Refers to the IS-WEB
webx	- Refers to the family of cards included in IS-WEBx (where x is S,L,X)
rpc		- Refers to the RPC100

STILL NEED TO STANDARDIZE THE 'MIDDLE' OF THE NAME...
